			<b>Life’s Tough</b> is an inspirational speech with some intense epic music,
produced to remind us that even though life can be tough for many of us, 
 WE are ultimately in charge.We are always in control of our reaction to circumstances in our life,
and we can choose to be strong and battle through the challenges, or give up. 
			<mark>NEVER GIVE UP!</mark>

						<b>Is it going to be easy?</b>
No. Is it going to be HARD? Hell yeah… And that is the best part.

						<br>
							<br>

									<u>The best part is pushing through the pain.</u>
									<br>
										<br>
The best part is the 
											<em>CHALLENGE.

You need to have goals that seem out of reach, At least goals that are HARD to reach.
You, pushing through all the crap in your way to get there.
YOU, clawing past all the demons to get to your goal. YOU, climbing and climbing to reach the top of that mountain peak NO ONE thought you could reach.
It’s YOU. Hearing your body say NO MORE and then hearing your mind say:
																<br>
																	<br>
																		<b> SHUT UP, I GOT THIS! I’m in charge today and you’re coming with me!</b>
																		<br>
																			<br>
																				<br>
You see, your mind is stronger than your body, and if you program your mind to always go one more round, to always push past what you perceive is your limit,   to give more than 
																					<b>ANYONE ELSE</b> would ever expect from you sooner or later your body will realize, this guy won’t let up, so I’m just going to have to 
																					<b>GROW</b> with him.
